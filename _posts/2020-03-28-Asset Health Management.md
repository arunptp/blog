# Introduction

<div align="justify">
  
Rapid adoption of renewable energy sources, changes in regulatory environment with the implementation of SCED/MBED, stringent enviromental norms are putting immense pressure on operation of thermal power plants. The above externalities are forcing increased cyclic operation of thermal fleets, wherein frequent start up and shutdowns are causing varying load on assets like boilers, feed pumps, motors, pipes. Under such conditions, ensuring availiablity and safety of equipments is of prime significance. Consequently, utilities needs to strategize for a transition from a reactive maintenance approach to real time condition based health management eventually leading to preventive maintenance (PdM).

This webpage illustrates estimation of residual useful life (RUL) of an equipment using deep learning. The equipment is operating normally at the start of each time series, and develops a fault at some point during the series. In the training set, the fault grows in magnitude until system failure. In the test set, the time series ends some time prior to system failure. The objective is to predict, "What is the probability that the equipment will fail in the next n cycles/days?".

A datascience based process is utilized for predictive maintenance. The steps include preparing the dataset, visually exploring it, partioning the dataset for training and validation, validating the models using unseen dataset.

# Towards Multi Sensor approach

<div align="justify">
  
  Generally, conditioning monitoring of a machine is done by looking at a sensor measurement (Eg. Temperature, Vibration ) and imposing bounds to it, i.e. under normal operating conditions, the measurement values are bounded by a maximum and minimum value (similar to control charts). Any deviation in the defined bounds sends an alarm. This is often generally defined as anamoly detection.

However, this method often sends false alarms (false positives) or misses an alarm (false negative). Furthermore, a single signal is observed/analysed in isolation. For example, an alarm may sound if the temperature exceeeds a certain level. A system defined above often cannot look at mutiple parameters and come to a conclusion about the state of a machine. Or technical parlance, one cannot take advantage of the multi-dimensionality of the data.

Anamoly detection using a one variable (vibration in a bearing dataset) is explored in detailed in my <a href="#">blog article</a>. By analysing past trends of healthy (black points in graph), the model learns the expected trend with acceptable variance .A trained model predicts the trends for the future (The blue line represents the expected values from 2004-02-15, 23:42:39 with the light blue portion showing the acceptable variance) and if any deviation is observed, an alarm can be raised.

# Softwares / Packages Used

<div align="justify">

All sofware packages used are open-sourced packages. The language used is Python and asscoiated packages like pandas, matplotlib. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using LSTM's is modeled using Tensorflow and Keras
  
  </div>

# The Data Set

<div align="justify">

Sensor Data is recorded for a fleet of engines of the same type (100 in total). Data sets consists of multiple multivariate time series. Each data set is further divided into training and test subsets. Each time series is from a different engine ‚Äì i.e., the data can be considered to be from a fleet of engines of the same type. Each engine starts with different degrees of initial wear and manufacturing variation which is unknown to the user. This wear and variation is considered normal, i.e., it is not considered a fault condition. There are three operational settings that have a substantial effect on engine performance. These settings are also included in the data. The data is contaminated with sensor noise.

The engine is operating normally at the start of each time series, and develops a fault at some point during the series. In the training set, the fault grows in magnitude until system failure. In the test set, the time series ends some time prior to system failure. The objective is to predict the number of remaining operational cycles before failure in the test set, i.e., the number of operational cycles after the last cycle that the engine will continue to operate.

Also provided a vector of true Remaining Useful Life (RUL) values for the test data.

The data are provided as a zip-compressed text file with 26 columns of numbers, separated by spaces. Each row is a snapshot of data taken during a single operational cycle, each column is a different variable. The columns correspond to:
1)	unit number
2)	time, in cycles
3)	operational setting 1
4)	operational setting 2
5)	operational setting 3
6)	sensor measurement  1
7)	sensor measurement  2
...
26)	sensor measurement  26

##  Visualizing Sensor Data


```
train_data_1 = train_data[train_data['id'] == 1]
plt = train_data_1[train_data_1.columns.difference(['id','cycle'])].plot(subplots=True, sharex=True, figsize=(10,20))

## Calculation of Residual Useful Life for Training Data

The dataset is formatted as an end of cycle dataset. First, we need to find the maximum cycle for each engine. Then at any point point the residual useful life is maximum cycle less current cycle number.


```
def cal_rul(data):
  """
  Calculate RUL from Cycle Column for each Engine
  Arguments:
  Nil
  Returns:
  train_data
  """

  maxlife = pd.DataFrame(data.groupby('id')['cycle'].max()).reset_index()
  maxlife.columns = ['id', 'max']
  data = data.merge(maxlife, on=['id'], how='left')
  rul = pd.DataFrame(data['max'] - data['cycle']).reset_index()
  rul.columns = ['No', 'rul']
  rul['id'] = data['id']

  return maxlife, rul
```


```
maxlife, rul_data = cal_rul(train_data)
```

## Analysis of life of 100 Engines used in Training Data


```
# Plot of life of 100 Engines
ax = maxlife.plot.barh(y='max', figsize=(20,10))
print('Max Life of Engines in hours/cycles (out of 100 engines in dataset):' ,  maxlife['max'].max())

# Deep Neural Network Model

<div align="justify">
Once the training data is cleaned, wrangled (Details in blog/GitHub), a model can be created learning from data.Deep learning is an aspect of artificial intelligence (AI) that is concerned with emulating the learning approach that human beings use to gain certain types of knowledge.

To understand deep learning, imagine a toddler whose first word is dog. The toddler learns what a dog is (and is not) by pointing to objects and saying the word dog. The parent says, "Yes, that is a dog," or, "No, that is not a dog." As the toddler continues to point to objects, he becomes more aware of the features that all dogs possess. What the toddler does, without knowing it, is clarify a complex abstraction (the concept of dog) by building a hierarchy in which each level of abstraction is created with knowledge that was gained from the preceding layer of the hierarchy.

Refering to the above analogy, for the case of prediction of whether a machine will fail in the next n cycles?, a deep learning model will observe examples with failures (training data), extract out features that will suggest that the machine is going to fail in next n cycles, similar to that of a toddler becoming aware of the features that dogs possess (tail, legs). For machine failures, traditionally skilled operators were able to discern such failures by observing sound of the machine or other features which they have gained through experience. Unlike the skilled operator or toddler, who will take year/months to understand the concept of "machine failure"/dog, a computer program that uses deep learning algorithms can be shown a training set and learn the skills.,With each observation and iteration, the model the computer creates becomes more complex and more accurate. To achieve an acceptable level of accuracy, deep learning programs require access to immense amounts of training data and processing power, neither of which were easily available until the era of big data and cloud computing.

A Sequential model is selected which connects each layer and pass the data from input to the output during the training process. In order for the model to learn time series data which are sequential, recurrent neural network (RNN) layer is created and a number of LSTM cells are added to the RNN. The schema is shown below.

y_pred = y_pred_prob > 0.99
y_true = Yseq_test
```


```
print('Confusion matrix\n- x-axis is true labels.\n- y-axis is predicted labels')

# Conclusion

<div align="justify">

The above showcases how asset health can be monitored based on telemetry data and how machine learning models can be deployed for failure predictions. The next step is to move from individual asset failures to entire portfolio of machines.

For example, an machine learning model defined above can be deployed for boiler feed pump (BFP) of a thermal power plant, Condendate Extraction Pump (CEP) and other equipments in the path of a the condensate feed water system. Such models can be aggregated for a health score of entire condensate feed water system. Such aggregation can transalate to health scores for entire asset portfolio, to subsystems and ultimately health/risk scores for entire systems like CHP, AHP, WTP systems etc.

Achieving such system for predictive maintenance (PdM) requires an open system architecture for collection and storage of data through IIoT technologies, requires deploying machine learning, AI and other predictive models, a visualization dashboard for end users The generation sector can benefit from this digital transformation from the convergence of operational technolgies (OT), informational technolgies (IT) and Artificial Intelligence.
