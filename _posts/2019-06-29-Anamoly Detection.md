**"The Mantra : Less time spent on figuring out the problem, more time spent on fixing and preventing it "**

<font color="blue">This notebook is intended to illustrate conditioning monitoring of industrial machinery by walking  through a real life dataset of bearing vibration data.</font>








# Introduction

Generally, conditioning monitoring of a machine is done by looking at a sensor mesurement (Eg. Temperature, Vibration ) and imposing bounds to it, i.e. under normal operating conditions, the measurement values are bounded by a maximum and minimum value (similar to control charts). Any deviation is the defined bounds sends an alarm. This is often generally defined ***as anamoly detection.***

However, this method often sends false alarms (false positives) or misses an alarm (false negative). Furthermore, a single signal is observed/analysed in isolation. For example, an alarm may sound if the temperature exceeeds a certain level. A system defined above often cannot look at mutiple parameters and come to a conclusion about the state of a machine. Or technical parlance, one cannot take advantage of the multi-dimensionality of the data.

This is where machine learning and other AI based techniques step in.  

This notes walks one through anamoly detection of a single dimension data (vibration). This is easier to visualise. The same principles hold true for mutildimensional data as well.

#Machine Learning Anamoly Detection Engine

A Machine Learning Anomaly Detection (MLAD) Engine uses sensor data like tempearture, flow, vibration and other variables (multi-dimensional) to create a multi-dimensional pattern ., i.e. the state of a machine is "learned" under healthy operating conditions.  By learning the healthy state, the engine guages if an alert should be triggered or not under any deviation.


The second step is to forecast the probability of future breakdown or in other words, asses the RUL (Residual Useful Life) of a machine. This provides valuable information regarding urgent repairs or regarding planned maintenance activity.


Finally, can integrate them into dashboards  or  into alarm systems that will be monitored by maintenance teams.

# Softwares / Packages Used

All sofware packages used are open-sourced packages. The language used is Python and asscoiated packages like pandas, matplotlib.

For anamoly detection, a open source package developed by Facebook team called Prophet is used.




# The Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the NASA repo https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/.

## Breif Description of Test Rig for Data Collection

This is a <em><b>"Run to Failure "</em></b> dataset.

Four bearings were installed on a shaft. The rotation speed was kept constant at 2000 RPM by an AC motor coupled to the shaft via rub belts.  A radial load of 6000 lbs is applied onto the shaft and bearing by a spring mechanism. All bearings are force lubricated.

Rexnord ZA-2115 double row bearings were installed on the shaft as shown in Figure 1. PCB 353B33 High Sensitivity Quartz ICP accelerometers were installed on the bearing housing (two accelerometers for each bearing [x- and y-axes] for data set 1, one accelerometer for each bearing for data sets 2 and 3). Sensor placement is also shown in figure. All failures occurred after exceeding designed life time of the bearing which is more than 100 million revolutions.

The above figure shows the accelereometer data for all four bearings. Bearing 1 fails at end of measurement, @ 2004-02-19 06:22:39.

Observing the time plot, it is pretty obvious that the vibration increases after 2004-02-16. However, how does a machine access that there has been an increase in bearing vibration?


## Zooming in Data for Bearing 1


```
fig = plt.figure()

# Divide the figure into a 1x2 grid, and give me the first section
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(121)
# Divide the figure into a 1x2 grid, and give me the second section
ax2 = fig.add_subplot(122)

healthy = merged_data['2004-02-12 11:02:39':'2004-02-12 23:52:39']
healthy['Bearing 1'].plot(figsize = (12,6), title="Healthy State" , legend = True, ax=ax1)
ax1.set(xlabel="Month-Date Time", ylabel="Vibration/Acceleration(g)")

faulty = merged_data['2004-02-18 11:02:39':'2004-02-18 23:52:39']
ax2 = faulty['Bearing 1'].plot(figsize = (12,6), title="Faulty State" , legend = True, ax= ax2)
ax2.set(xlabel="Month-Date Time", ylabel="Vibration/Acceleration(g)")


```




    [Text(0, 0.5, 'Vibration/Acceleration(g)'), Text(0.5, 0, 'Month-Date Time')]

The above graphs shows the vibration data fro bearing 1 at the for the same time peiod , '11:02:39' to "23:52:39' on 12th (Healthy) and on the 18th(Faulty/Poor Heath Score).

The vibration is definetly higher. Furthermore, the frequency component are also different.  It is easy to identify for one variable (one dimension). However, when the number of variables (dimensions) increase, i.e. when we consider more variable likes temperature, humidity etc., the complexity increases.

The beauty of ML lies in the fact that the same methods hold true for mutli dimensional data as well. Multiple sensor variables (dimensions) can be considered to get a more accurate measure of the "Health Score" of a machine.

# Anamoly Detection using Prophet Package (Black Box Modelling)

Anomaly detection problem for time series can be formulated as finding outlier data points relative to some standard or usual signal. Our focus shall be from a machine persopective, such as unexpected spikes, level shift pointing to deteriorating health of a machine.

Prophet is open source software released by Facebookâ€™s Core Data Science team.



```
from fbprophet import Prophet
```

## Creating Training Data Set
The training of the anamoly detection model is using data from the healthy phase of the bearing. The input to Prophet is always a dataframe with two columns: ds and y. The ds (datestamp) column should be of a format expected by Pandas, ideally YYYY-MM-DD for a date or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for a timestamp. The y column must be numeric, and represents the measurement we wish to forecast.


```
healthy_bearing1 = merged_data['2004-02-12 10:32:39':'2004-02-15 23:42:39']['Bearing 1']

# Creating training dataframe
prophet_healthy_train = pd.DataFrame()
prophet_healthy_train['ds'] = healthy_bearing1.index
prophet_healthy_train['y'] = healthy_bearing1.values

prophet_healthy_train.head()

## Creating the Model

Calling the In-Bulit Prophet Module for training a model


```
m = Prophet(interval_width = 1)
# Using the training data from "healthy part"
m.fit(prophet_healthy_train)
```

    INFO:fbprophet:Disabling yearly seasonality. Run prophet with yearly_seasonality=True to override this.
    INFO:fbprophet:Disabling weekly seasonality. Run prophet with weekly_seasonality=True to override this.





    <fbprophet.forecaster.Prophet at 0x7f84a9ec7da0>



## Evaluation on Training Data


```
forecast = m.predict(prophet_healthy_train)
forecast['fact'] = prophet_healthy_train['y'].reset_index(drop = True)
print('Displaying Prophet plot')
fig1 = m.plot(forecast)
fig1 = healthy_bearing1.plot(figsize = (12,6), title="Fit of Training Data")
fig1.set(xlabel="Month (MM)-Date(DD) Time", ylabel="Vibration/Acceleration(g)")

```

The black points are the true data points of the vibration sensor. The blue line represents the fitted line (trend line) with the light blue portion showing the acceptable variance.

## Evaluation on Test Data (Unseen, Fault Data)

Finally, the moment of truth!

Can the model developed above detect faulty machine condition. To evaluate this, the fault portion of the data is fed into the model.

Note that this data has not been seen by the model during training stage.


```
prophet_faultydata = merged_data['2004-02-15 23:22:39':'2004-02-16 23:52:39']['Bearing 1']
prophet_faultydata.head()

prophet_faulty_test = pd.DataFrame()

prophet_faulty_test['ds'] = prophet_faultydata.index
#pd.to_datetime(prophet_healthy.index, format='%Y.%m.%d.%H.%M.%S')
prophet_faulty_test['y'] = prophet_faultydata.values

forecast = m.predict(prophet_faulty_test)
forecast['fact'] = prophet_faulty_test['y'].reset_index(drop = True)
print('Displaying Prophet plot')
fig1 = m.plot(forecast)
fig1 = prophet_faultydata.plot(figsize = (12,6),title="Fit of Test/Unseen/Fault Data")

The black points are the true data points of the vibration sensor. The blue line represents the expected values from 2004-02-15, 23:42:39  with the light blue portion showing the acceptable variance.

Clearly, the values are higher than the predicted values and an alarm can be sounded.


```
# Healper functions to annotate the graph.
print(fig1.get_xticks())
print(fig1.get_yticks())
```

    [731623.875 731624.375 731624.875 731625.375 731625.875 731626.375
     731626.875 731627.375 731627.875]
    [0.055 0.06  0.065 0.07  0.075 0.08  0.085]


# Conclusion

By analysing past trends of healthy, the model learns the expected trend with acceptable variance (hyperparameter).The trained model predicts the trends for the future and if any deviation is observed, an alarm can be raised.

The same principle hold true for analysing multiple signal (multi-dimensional) at a time and creating a single metric like, the "health score" of a machine.

Using such predictive maintenace strategies, one can find the earliest stages of damage and reduce operating costs. Rather than shutting down equipment for scheduled preventive maintenance routines, maintenance can be planned to match convenient schedules and improve reliability. Predictive maintenance uses sensors, machine learning, and advanced algorithms to detect faults and predict failure. Connecting to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) enables access to historical baseline data while building the statistical and trend analyses that point to why and where problems occur and what actions are needed.
